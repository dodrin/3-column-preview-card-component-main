### Built with

- CSS Grid

### What I learned

I learned about mix-blend-mode property that I did not know from this project. Also I used not flexbox but CSS grid for responsive design this time, that was another lerning though still I have some stuff I need to figure out.


### Useful resources

- [resource 1](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/mix-blend-mode#specifications) - This page helped me to make hover button using mix-blend-mode and learn about it.


- [resource 2](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/) - I used this resource to make CSS grid layout.

- [resource 3](https://ishadeed.com/article/css-grid-minmax/)
- This resource was really helpful and easy to understand minmax() property.
